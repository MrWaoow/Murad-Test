1. Client's Goal:

The client's primary goal for this project was to develop a secure and user-friendly website for their online refund service. This website caters to clients who need assistance with obtaining refunds for online orders from specific stores. The key objectives of the website are:

Client Login via Telegram: Enable secure user login using Telegram accounts for streamlined authentication.
Country and Store Selection: Allow clients to choose from three supported countries (USA, Canada, UK) and navigate a dedicated "Refundable Stores" page displaying stores within each selected country.
Refund Form Submission: Provide a user-friendly "Submit Form" page accessible to signed-in clients. This form should facilitate the initiation of refund requests for online purchases.
My Refunds Section: Implement a "My Refunds" page where clients can track the status of their submitted refund requests.
Missed Drops Page: Include a dedicated "Missed Drops" page (purpose to be determined based on client's needs).
Terms & Conditions: Display the website's Terms & Conditions, outlining user responsibilities regarding payment confirmations, communication, and potential service restrictions.
